# clusty
Clusty is a command-line utility for running a number of node applications in parallel.

## Use

Install clusty globally:
```sh
npm install -g clusty
```

You run clusty at the root path of a number of applications. clusty allows you to `start`, `stop` or `watch` your cluster. It will log output files to `.clusty` and you can execute tail operations on the log files for a given service.


Given an application
```sh
\app
|__\service-a
|__\service-b
|__\service-c
```

Inside of the root application directoy, you can run clusty to manage the sub-services:
```sh
# start the cluster of services (uses npm start)
clusty start

# stop the cluster of service
clusty stop

# watch files in the cluster (uses npm run watch)
clusty watch
```

You can also see what is running:
```sh
clusty ps
```

You can look at the log files being generated by your application:
```sh
clusty tail app-service-a
clusty tail -n 100 app-service-a
```

You can tail a log file as well
```sh
clusty tail -f app-service-a
```
