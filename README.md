# lightbird
Lightbird is a command-line utility for running a number of node applications in parallel. 

## Use

Install lightbird globally:
```sh
npm install -g lightbird
```

You run lightbird at the root path of a number of applications. Lightbird allows you to `start`, `stop` or `watch` your cluster. It will log output files to `.lightbird` and you can execute tail operations on the log files for a given service.


Given an application
```sh
\app
|__\service-a
|__\service-b
|__\service-c
```

You can run lightbird to manage the sub-services:
```sh
# start the cluster of services (uses npm start)
lightbird start

# stop the cluster of service
lightbird stop

# watch files in the cluster (uses npm run watch)
lightbird watch 
```

You can also see what is running:
```sh
lightbird list
```

You can look at the log files being generated by your application:
```sh
lightbird logs app-service-a
lightbird logs app-service-a -n 100
```

You can tail a log file as well
```sh
lightbird logs app-service-a -f
```
