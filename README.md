# clusty
Clusty is a command-line utility for running a number of node applications in parallel.

## Use

Install clusty globally:
```sh
npm install -g clusty
```

You run clusty at the root path of a number of applications. Clusty allows you to `start`, `stop` or `watch` your cluster. It will log output files to `.clusty` and you can execute tail operations on the log files for a given service.


Clusty is designed to work at a root of a number of Node projects.  In the diagram below, you would execute clusty commands while inside `app`. These commands would be executed on the sub-services (that are Node applications) that are children to `app`.
```sh
\app
|__\service-a
|__\service-b
|__\service-c
```

Inside of the root application directoy, you can run clusty to manage the sub-services:
```sh
# start the cluster of services (uses npm start)
clusty start

# stop the cluster of service
clusty stop
```

You can also start any script for a service
```sh
clusty start --script <script>
clusty start --script watch
```

You can also execute any npm script across all nodes with
```sh
clusty run <script>
clusty run build
```

You can see what is running in the cluster
```sh
clusty ps
```

You can look at the log files being generated by your application:
```sh
clusty tail
clusty tail <uid|index>
clusty tail evil_tesla
```

You can stream the tail as well
```sh
clusty tail -f
clusty tail -f <uid|index>
clusty tail -f evil_tesla
```
